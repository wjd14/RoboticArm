# RoboticArm

This is the repo for the code that controls the robotic arm built by Will Doyle and Ben Plamondon. It uses 4 AX-12 servos.

The main method is in the Desktop directory, and is called main.py. It creates a variety of objects which serve different purposes in detecting objects, moving to those objects, picking them up, and delivering them.
